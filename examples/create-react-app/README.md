# `create-react-app` + `lmstudio.js` example

This example demonstrates how to use the LM Studio TypeScript SDK in a React application created with `create-react-app`.

It was created by running `npx create-react-app my-lms-app --template typescript` and then adding the LM Studio SDK to it by running `npm install @lmstudio/sdk`.

Use it as a reference implementation or as a starting point for your own project.

Visit the LM Studio SDK documentation at [https://lmstudio.ai/docs/](https://lmstudio.ai/docs/) for more information.

## 1. Prerequisites

1. If you don't have it installed already, get LM Studio from [https://lmstudio.ai/mit-hackathon](https://lmstudio.ai/mit-hackathon)

2. Set up your LM Studio dev tools (`lms`):
    ### macOS / Linux
    - #### Zsh (Oh My Zsh)
      ```bash
      echo 'export PATH="$HOME/.cache/lmstudio/bin:$PATH"' >> ~/.zshrc
      ```

    - #### Bash
      ```bash
      echo 'export PATH="$HOME/.cache/lmstudio/bin:$PATH"' >> ~/.bashrc
      ```
    > *Not sure which shell you're using? Pop open your terminal and run `echo $SHELL` to find out. `/bin/zsh` means you're using Zsh, `/bin/bash` means you're using Bash.*

      #### ðŸ‘‰ Test that you have it all working by running `lms` in your terminal. 

    ### Windows
    - `lms.exe` should already be in your PATH after installation. Test it by running `lms.exe` in powershell or cmd.


## 2. Download local LLMs
To use this example, you will need to have at least one LLM downloaded locally. You can download LLMs from the LM Studio app.
Check the featured models in the app's home page, or browse LM Studio's Hugging Face page: https://huggingface.co/lmstudio-community.

## 3. Hack with React + lmstudio.js

1. Clone this repository

2. Install dependencies

```bash
  npm install
```

3. Start the development server

```bash
npm start
```


4. Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your browser
